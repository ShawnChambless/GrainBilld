# My Personal Project: Grain Billd
### http://grainbilld.com

## \*Disclaimer:
I did not get all of this done during the three week personal-project time. My authentication did not cooperate until after. Some of this code is written poorly, and could certainly be rewritten. This is meant only as a reference if you don't understand how to write something, or approach a complicated problem.

## Auth
> - If your project needs authentication, hard-code user info until we cover it in class. You can use my authentication files for reference after that.

## Database
> - I had to make my own API for this project, as I could not find a public beer ingredient API, therefore, I made a front and back-end interface to add/edit data in the database. Again, this may not have been the best way to tackle this part, but it should provide a pretty good reference if you need to push a lot of data to your database.
